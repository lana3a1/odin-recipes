 <img src="recipe-img/strawberry-lemonade-crinkle-cookies.webp" alt="Pink Strawberry Lemonade Crinkle Cookies on a white plate with fresh strawberries" width="350">
<p>Sweet strawberry meets zesty lemon in these soft pink crinkle cookies, finished with a light dusting of powdered sugar.</p>
<p>Each bite offers a balanced combination of fruity strawberry sweetness and subtle citrus freshness, with a soft, chewy texture that makes these cookies both refreshing and satisfying.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Cookie Dough</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter
        softened</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon strawberry extract</li>
    <li>Pink food coloring
        optional, for a soft strawberry-
        lemonade hue</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Rolling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F
        (175°) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Cream butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Beat in the egg, then mix in lemon juice, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and strawberry extract.</li>
    <li>Add dry ingredients to the wet mixture and mix just until combined.</li>
    <li>Tint dough lightly with pink food coloring if desired. Chill dough for 30-45 minutes for best crinkles.</li>
    <li>Scoop dough into 1 1/2-tablespoon balls. Roll each ball in granulated sugar, then generously in powdered sugar.</li>
    <li>Place cookies 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets.</li>
    <li>Bake for 11-13 minutes, until cookies are puffed, cracked, and set around the edges but soft in the center.</li>
    <li>Cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chilling the dough is essential</strong>for bold crinkles and thicker cookies; don't skip the 30-45 minute chill.</li>
<li>Roll dough <strong>first in granulated sugar, the powdered sugar</strong>to keep the powdered sugar from dissolving while baking.</li>
<li>For a<strong>natural strawberry flavor</strong>, replace strawberry extract with <strong>1 1/2 tablespoons freeze-dried strawberry powder.</strong></li>
<li>Fresh lemon juice gives the brightest flavor, but<strong>bottled lemon juice works in a pinch.</strong></li>
<li>For softer cookies, remove them when the centers look slightly underbaked-they will set as they cool.</li>
<li>Dough can be<strong>made ahead and refrigerated up to 24 hours</strong>before baking.</li>
<li>Store baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for<strong>up to 4 days,</strong>or freeze for<strong>up to 2 month.</strong> </li>
</ul>
